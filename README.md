# BarberBooker

**BarberBooker** is a Barber's Reservation App that enables users to easily book appointments with their preferred barber at a barbershop. This app allows customers to schedule haircuts and other services, view available slots, and get notifications for upcoming appointments. Itâ€™s built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **Firebase** as the backend to handle authentication, database management, and notifications. The app also uses **SharedPreferences** for storing user preferences locally.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**  
  Users can sign up and log in using their email/password.  
  Authentication is handled via **Firebase Authentication**.

- **Appointment Scheduling**  
  Users can browse available barbers, select a service (e.g., haircut, shave), and reserve a time slot.  
  Availability is fetched in real-time using **Firebase Firestore**.

- **Admin Panel (Barber Interface)**  
  Barbers can manage their availability and view upcoming appointments via an easy-to-use interface.

## Tech Stack
